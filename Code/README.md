# Bird Species Classification using CNN

This project is a deep learning-based web application to classify bird species (gull, oriole, and sparrow) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, and the web interface is developed using Flask.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop a system capable of identifying bird species from images using a deep learning model. We classify three types of birds:
- **Gull**
- **Oriole**
- **Sparrow**

The project uses a CNN model trained on images of these birds and provides a web interface for users to upload images for classification.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bird-classification
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
   - TensorFlow
   - Keras
   - Flask
   - NumPy
   - Pillow

4. Make sure you have a compatible GPU set up (optional for faster training).

## Dataset

You can use your own dataset of bird images. The model is designed to classify three bird species, and the images should be organized into folders for each class:
- `birds/gull`
- `birds/oriole`
- `birds/sparrow`

Ensure that each folder contains enough images for training.

## Model Architecture

The CNN model is built using Keras and TensorFlow. It consists of several convolutional layers followed by max-pooling and dropout layers to prevent overfitting. The final output layer uses the Softmax activation function for multi-class classification.

The architecture includes:
- Conv2D layers with ReLU activation
- MaxPooling2D layers
- Dropout layers for regularization
- Fully connected Dense layers

### Model Summary:

| Layer | Type | Output Shape | Parameters |
|-------|------|--------------|------------|
| Conv2D | 16 filters (3x3) | 300x300x16 | 448 |
| MaxPooling2D | Pool size (2x2) | 150x150x16 | 0 |
| Dropout | 0.2 | - | 0 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| Dense | 128 neurons | 128 | 4,194,560 |
| Output | Softmax (3 classes) | 3 | 387 |

## Web Application

The web app is built using Flask. Users can upload an image of a bird, and the app will classify it using the pre-trained model.

### Routes:
- `/`: The homepage where users can upload images.
- `/upload`: Handles image uploads and returns the predicted bird species.

## Usage

1. Train the model using `alg.py` (or load the pre-trained model):
   ```bash
   python alg.py
   ```

2. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python sample.py
   ```

3. Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000/`. You can now upload bird images for classification.

## Results

The CNN model achieved good accuracy in distinguishing between the three bird species. Below are some sample outputs:

- Gull: 97% accuracy
- Oriole: 95% accuracy
- Sparrow: 96% accuracy

Feel free to test the application with your own images and improve upon the model.

## Future Improvements

- Expand the dataset to include more bird species.
- Fine-tune the model for better performance on real-world images.
- Add additional layers and tweak hyperparameters to improve model accuracy.
- Implement an API for integration with other applications.
